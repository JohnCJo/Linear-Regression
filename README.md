# Linear-RegressionYou are given a real estate dataset (Download) consisting of the prices per unit area of
different houses which have been sold. In addition to the prices, the dataset shows other
information about the houses which include transaction date, age of the house, distance
to the nearest Metro Train Station (Metro Rail Transit- MRT) from the house, number of
convenience stores and the latitude and longitude of the location. Imagine that the prices
of houses linearly depend upon the age, distance to the MRT station and the number of
convenience stores. Write a program to predict the price when you are given the features
of a new house. FInd the line that fits the dataset using (1) Normal Equations and (2)
Gradient Descent Algorithm without using a linear regression library function, Finally, use
scikit-learn library function to find the best fit line.

(Use the notebook file to experiment with the code)
